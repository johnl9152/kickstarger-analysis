# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
In this challenge, Louise needed assistance in organizing a spreadsheet for Kickstarter campaign. A specific data that Louise required was the trends of theatrical projects, like plays.

The purpose of this challenge is to fully incorporate the excel skills learned from Module 1 and analyze if performance of plays had any relationship with the launch dates and the funding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
When the excel spreasheet was first given, there was a necessity for more analysis because the spreadsheet was still too broad to analyze so the process of breaking down the data. For example, the column for category and subcategory had to be broken down to two separate columns through "Convert Text to Column Wizard".
The end goal was to see if there was any relationship between funding goals and the plays' launch date.
