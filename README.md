# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
In this challenge, Louise needed assistance in organizing a spreadsheet for Kickstarter campaign. A specific data that Louise required was the trends of theatrical projects, like plays.

The purpose of this challenge is to fully incorporate the excel skills learned from Module 1 and analyze if performance of plays had any relationship with the launch dates and the funding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
When the excel spreasheet was first given, there was a necessity for more analysis because the spreadsheet was still too broad to analyze so the process of breaking down the data. For example, the column for category and subcategory had to be broken down to two separate columns through "Convert Text to Column Wizard".
The end goal was to see if there was any relationship between funding goals and the plays' launch date. In order to do so, further organization was needed in the Kickstarter spreadsheet by creating the "years" column from the "date created conversion" column made previously. Afterward, a pivot table was created, titled "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date", to further sort the spreadsheet. In the pivot table field, "parent category" and "years" were placed in filter, "outcomes" was placed in columns, "date created conversion" was placed in rows, and "count of outcome" was placed in values. In addition, the pivot table was further sorted by showing only "theater" numbers through filtering the "parent category" and the "count of outcomes" was organized through ascedning from January to December. Lastly, a line graph created to showed the pivot table's relationship between the launch date and the campaign's outcomes through individual months in a year.
